# Java Generics Exercises

## 📄 Description - Statement of the Exercise

This repository contains a set of Java exercises designed to practice **Java Generics** with classes and methods.  
All exercises must be executed from the command line or via an IDE.  

- **Exercise 1 (NoGenericMethods)**:  
  Create a class `NoGenericMethods` that stores three arguments of the same type. Implement methods to store and retrieve these objects and a constructor to initialize the three values. Test that arguments can be passed in any order when calling the constructor.

- **Exercise 2 (GenericMethods with Persona)**:  
  Create a `Persona` class with attributes `name`, `surname`, and `age`. Then, create a class `GenericMethods` with a **generic method** that accepts three arguments of different types and prints them. Test the method in `Main` by passing objects of different types, including a `Persona` object, `String`, and numeric types, in any order.
